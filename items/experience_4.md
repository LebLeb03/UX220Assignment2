### Co-op in High School 
1. What was it that you did?
    I took part in a Co-op program in high school where I taught kindergarterners. 
2. When did you do it?
    I did this in grade 11 I had to do 40 - 60 hours of co-op undersupervision of a registered teacher and taught kindergarteners.  
3. What was good about it?
    I really liked the satisfaction I got when the kids could say their ABC's and do simple math with me, it felt like I achived something. 
4. What was your favourite memory of it?
    My favourite memory was from when I was able to help a little boy learn the math and he gave me the biggest hug and could not stop smiling the rest of the day. 
5. What didn't you enjoy about it?
    The part I did not enjoy was due to the children as well. Some kids were not well behaved so when I would work with them they would not listen and cause my day to be very long and not very easy. 
6. Give your experience a letter "grade."
    Letter Grade I give this is a "C". It could have gone better and I would have enjoyed having a nicer group of kids.
