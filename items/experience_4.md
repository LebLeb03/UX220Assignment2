### Church volunteering

1. What was it that you did?
    When I was 13 I started to volunteer at my family Church and I volunteered on the tech team and the event staff team. 

2. When did you do it?
    I volunteered since I was 13 so its been about 8 years and Im still voluntering to this day. 
3. What was good about it?
    When I was 13 I was able to become an event staff leader and really exceled at the counting of the cash for tithe and greeting guests. I ever so often reminisce on how far I have come from when I was 13 and luagh.
4. What was your favourite memory of it?
    My favourite memory was from putting on my first show while building the set, while also working as a manager and doing an overnight the same day as the show. From 0 hours of sleep to setting up and running a whole show. 
5. What didn't you enjoy about it?
    The most unejoyable part is either having to wake up at 7 am every sunday to be setting up at church, but other than that I dont have naything else to complain on not enjoy. 
6. Give your experience a letter "grade."
    Letter Grade I give is "A," and it couldn't be better I got closer to my church and built roots which I value.
