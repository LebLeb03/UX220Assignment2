### The Car Shop 
1. What was it that you did?

    I still do this but the mainly was done when I was 16 and 17 in 2019.
3. What was good about it?
    I learned how each car operates, can now change my own oil and understand how to take apart my own cars parts to replace. 
4. What was your favourite memory of it?
    My favourite memory was when my father bought tires for a car, but when we tried to change them the bolts we to tough to break that we ended up having to cut them off. This was a very funny laugh and worked itself in the end of it. 
5. What didn't you enjoy about it?
    I did not enjoy how cold in the winter the shop could get,(-10+).
